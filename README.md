# Data Visualization & Regression Model Dashboard

Developed an advanced interactive Streamlit dashboard allowing users to upload custom datasets and instantly view an interactive summary table with automated highlighting of missing values and outliers.

Implemented robust data preprocessing to remove irrelevant columns, handle missing values (deletion or replacement), and prepare datasets for analysis.

Integrated dynamic visualization options including scatter plots with marginal histograms, pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and interactive relation plots (scatter and box).

Enabled flexible regression model training with multiple algorithms — Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Decision Tree — for varied analytical needs.

Delivered comprehensive post-training insights such as feature importance (chart and table), regression equations, model performance metrics, actual vs predicted plots, residual analysis (scatter, histogram, combined), and learning curves.

Added advanced analytical capabilities including predictions with custom inputs and all subset regression for optimal feature selection.
