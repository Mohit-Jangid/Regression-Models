## **📊 Interactive Data Visualization & Regression Modeling Dashboard**

An advanced, end-to-end analytical platform built on **Streamlit**, designed to guide users from **raw data ingestion** to **actionable predictive insights** — all in a seamless, interactive, and visually compelling environment.

---

### **🚀 Getting Started**

#### **Upload Your Data with Ease**

* **Supported Formats**: Effortlessly work with industry-standard file types — `.csv` and `.xlsx` — ensuring maximum compatibility with common data sources.
* **Simple Upload Workflow**: Use the intuitive **“Choose a CSV or Excel file”** uploader to instantly load your dataset without manual imports or complex setup.
* **Smart Data Cleaning on Upload**: Automatically detects and removes irrelevant or unnamed columns, blank fields, and empty structures that often clutter raw data, ensuring a clean starting point.

---

### **📋 Data Preview & Instant Profiling**

* **Interactive Data Snapshot**: Immediately preview your dataset in a clean, scrollable table upon upload.
* **Automated Issue Highlighting**: Missing values and statistical outliers are dynamically highlighted, enabling faster identification of data quality issues.
* **Comprehensive Summary Report**: Instantly view a breakdown of column names, data types, counts, and missing value percentages — all designed to give you a rapid yet thorough understanding of your dataset’s structure.

---

### **🛠 Data Preprocessing Made Simple**

* **Column Pruning**: Drop non-essential or irrelevant fields (e.g., free-text notes, IDs) that add noise to visualization or modeling.
* **Advanced Missing Value Handling**:

  * **Remove**: Exclude rows with missing entries for a stricter dataset.
  * **Replace**: Fill missing values using statistical methods like **mean**, **median**, or **mode** to retain maximum usable data without introducing bias.

---

### **🔀 Flexible Workflow Selection**

Choose between **Data Visualization** for exploratory analysis or **Model Prediction** for training regression models — or combine both for a complete analytics cycle.

---

### **📈 Data Visualization Capabilities**

1. **Scatter with Marginal Histogram**

   * Plot two variables with accompanying histograms along both axes for a detailed look at distribution and correlation.
2. **Pair Plot**

   * Automatically generate pairwise scatterplots for multiple features to reveal linear and non-linear relationships.
3. **Correlation Heatmap**

   * Visualize correlations in an interactive matrix, instantly spotting multicollinearity or strong associations.
4. **Interactive Scatter & Box Plots**

   * Explore relationships and compare distributions interactively — filter and zoom without leaving the dashboard.

---

### **🤖 Model Prediction & Training**

#### **Data Preparation for Modeling**

* **Outlier Management**: Keep, drop, or replace outliers using **mean** or **median** strategies, reducing noise for more accurate predictions.
* **Target & Feature Selection**: Define your dependent variable and pick relevant predictors from your dataset with a click.

#### **Supported Regression Models**

* **Linear Regression** – Fast and interpretable; ideal for continuous outcomes with linear relationships.
* **Ridge Regression** – Adds regularization to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
* **Lasso Regression** – Regularizes and performs automatic feature selection.
* **Decision Tree Regression** – Tree-based, interpretable models that adapt to non-linear patterns.
* **Random Forest Regression** – Ensemble of decision trees for improved stability and accuracy.

#### **Model Training Process**

* Hit **“Train Model”** to execute training with real-time progress updates — results are ready in seconds.

### **📊 Post-Training Insights & Analytics**

1. **Feature Importance (Chart & Table)**

   * Quantifies the impact of each input variable; view in ranked table form or as a visual bar chart.
2. **Regression Equation**

   * For linear-based models, the dashboard displays the full mathematical equation linking predictors to the target.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * **Adjusted R² / R²**: Explains variance coverage.
   * **MAE, MSE, RMSE**: Quantifies prediction error in multiple dimensions for accuracy assessment.
4. **Advanced Visualization Tools**:

   * **Actual vs Predicted Plot** – Checks model fit.
   * **Residual Histogram** – Spots prediction biases.
   * **Residual Scatter Plot** – Detects error trends.
   * **Residual Scatter + Histogram Combo** – Combines both for deeper error diagnostics.
   * **Learning Curve** – Reveals overfitting/underfitting trends as training size changes.
5. **Custom Input Prediction**

   * Enter your own feature values and get immediate predictions from the trained model.

---

### **🔍 All Subset Regression (Advanced Feature)**

* Runs regression models for **every possible combination of features** to identify the best predictor set.
* Outputs for each subset:

  * Evaluation metrics
  * Regression equation
  * Feature importance (chart & table)
  * Actual vs predicted plots
  * Residual analysis (scatter, histogram, combo)
  * Learning curve analysis
